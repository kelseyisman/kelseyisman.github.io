[The Hidden Opponent](https://www.thehiddenopponent.org/) is a non-profit organization that works to reduce mental health stigma and promote vulnerable conversation among groups of student-athletes. The [Campus Captains](https://www.thehiddenopponent.org/campus-captains) student advocacy program supports over 400 student-athletes. I created a [program syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l4MGgCNVGvRksPUT2owO1bVfEXE_ARYjzxs3MEsB7CY/edit?usp=sharing) with monthly content themes and diverse activity options, including panel discussions, social media initiatives, mental health trainings, and other on-campus event templates.
