[The Hidden Opponent](https://www.thehiddenopponent.org/) is a non-profit organization that works to reduce mental health stigma and promote vulnerable conversation among groups of student-athletes. The [Campus Captains](https://www.thehiddenopponent.org/campus-captains) student advocacy program supports over 400 student-athletes. I created a [program syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QtCuOUKo220EKG854x49V2aCqkctEcYXjpEyk9MOKqQ/edit?usp=sharing) with monthly content themes and educational events led by clinical professionals in the field. I also oversee administrative tasks such as regular meetings with Campus Captain group leaders, managing the program's resources and associated documents, and the registration for our live webinar events. I also have experience in developing [blog posts](https://www.thehiddenopponent.org/post/from-jocks-to-docs-how-two-football-players-are-giving-back) and social media content, and I have planned multiple mental health outreach events.
