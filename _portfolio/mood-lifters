[Mood-Lifters](https://ssw.umich.edu/offices/research/projects-grants/mood-lifters-a-novel-approach-to-mental-wellness/13625) is a mental health program that was developed by psychologists and social workers at the University of Michigan. The program is peer-delivered and provides evidence-based mental health techqniues to group members. I completed the student-athlete cohort of Mood-Lifters and later served as a group-helper, assisting the group leader in preparing for and delivering fifteen mental health sessions.
