[Our Minds Matter](https://ourmindsmatter.org/) (OMM) is a non-profit organization working toward the day when no teen dies by suicide. In 2018, I brought OMM to Yorktown High School and served as co-president of the YHS Minds Matter chapter. During my senior year of high school, I organized a fundraiser for OMM with the Yorktown High School Swim Team, providing mental health training and activities to our team of over 100 swimmers. As a summer intern in 2020, my brother and I worked to adapt OMM's curriculum for student-athletes, creating the [Athletes' Minds Matter Guidebook](https://ourmindsmatter.org/guidebook-and-pptx/), [team activities](https://ourmindsmatter.org/team-activities/), and [mental health resources](https://ourmindsmatter.org/athlete-mh-resources/) specifically for athletes. I also facilitated a collaboration between OMM and The Hidden Opponent to organize and host a "Mens' Minds Matter" panel event in November of 2020.
