[The Helping Up Mission](https://helpingupmission.org/) (HUM) is a shelter and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment facility in Baltimore City. Through the HUM Volunteer Scientist program, I contributed to the development and delivery of bilingual (English and Spanish) programming for "Science of SUD" classes delivered to HUM's residents.
