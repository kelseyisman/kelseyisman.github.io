I am a postbacclauate research fellow at the Intramural Research Program at the National Institute on Drug Abuse. I work in the Technology and Translational Research Unit (TTRU) under Dr. Brenda Curtis, which is a lab in the Translational Addiction Medicine Branch. In the TTRU, I study the perceived stigma associated with substance use disorder and its role in clinical outcomes as well as the applications of large language models in addiction science settings. I am a prospective clinical psychology student, and I hope to study computational psychological methods for reducing health stigma within the context of mental health, substance use disorder, and HIV. I am also interested in the role of machine learning and computational psychology in encouraging health equity and tailored mental health intervention.
