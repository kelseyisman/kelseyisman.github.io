I am a PhD student in the Clinical Psychology department at Indiana University in the Developmental Psychopathology Lab under Dr. Brian D'Onofrio. I was previously postbacclauate research fellow at the Intramural Research Program at the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In the Developmental Psychopathology Lab at IU, I study the stigma associated with substance use and epidemiological methods for studying substance use and mental health.
